		<P>My name is Matt McAllister, and I am a sophomore transfer student at the university of Maine.
		Throughout my life, i've lived in three different places. I was born in New Haven, Connecticut
		in December, 1997. My parents decided to move down to Georgia when I was less than a year old.
		We lived in Alpharetta, Georgia for about 7 years, during which my younger brother, Ethan was born.
		When I was about 7, my family and I moved up to Wells, Maine for my Father's job, and to be closer to our relatives,
		as my mom is from New Jersey and my father is from Maine. Currently, I live with my mom in a different house in 
		Wells, along with my 7-year-old dog named Teddy.</P>
