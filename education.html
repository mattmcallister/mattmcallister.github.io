		<P>I graduated Wells High School in 2016, and attended Southern New Hampshire University
		for one full year as a Business Administration major. I decided to be a business major, because i've always
		been interested in how that industry works. After spending a year living on campus as a full-time student at 
		SNHU, I decided that I wanted to be a part of a bigger school. I made up my mind that I wanted 
		to transfer to the University of Maine. Once making the decision to commit to UMaine,
		I kept my major as Business Administration and chose a focus in marketing.</P>
