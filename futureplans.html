		<P>As previously stated on my <a HREF="personalinterests.html">Personal Interests</a> page, 
		I spent a lot of time learning how to do hair. This includes hair color, haircuts, hair extensions,
		and making wigs. I have never been to cosmetology school, however for the past 10 years I have
		done my fair share of extensive training and research. I have shadowed hair stylists, taken online classes, 
		watched videos, and repeatedly putting the information I have learned to the test by trying it myself over and 
		over again until I was satisfied with the results. Unfortunately, in order to work in a salon I must
		go to cosmetology school, even though I have learned most of curriculum on my own. After college,
		I plan to get a job in the business industry in order to pay back student loans and go to cosmetology school part-time.
		After getting my cosmetology license, I plan to formulate and create my own brand of hair products 
		that will be available to the general public and to salons, in addition to a unique hair color line specifically 
		formulated to improve the health of a client's hair that will be available only to trained professional hair stylists. </P>
